    options: ["60", "40", "80", "70"],
    answer: "60",
    solution: "Product of numbers = LCM × HCF = 120 × 10 = 1200. Other number = 1200 / 20 = 60."

    question: "HCF of two numbers is 11 and their LCM is 770. If one number is 77, find the other.",
    options: ["110", "99", "121", "88"],
    answer: "110",
    solution: "Other number = (HCF × LCM) / Given number = (11 × 770) / 77 = 110."

    options: ["100", "196", "196", "244"],
    answer: "196",
    solution: "LCM of (12,16,24) = 48. Required number = 48 + 4 = 52, 96, 196... 196 is the correct."

    question: "If the LCM of two numbers is 90 and their HCF is 15, what is the product of the two numbers?",
    options: ["1200", "1350", "1350", "1500"],
    answer: "1350",
    solution: "Product = LCM × HCF = 90 × 15 = 1350."

  {
    question: "The HCF of two numbers is 8 and their LCM is 96. One number is 16, find the other.",
    options: ["48", "32", "24", "64"],
    answer: "48",
    solution: "Other number = (HCF × LCM) / given = (8 × 96)/16 = 768 / 16 = 48."
  },
  {
    question: "Find the smallest number which when increased by 17 is exactly divisible by 12, 16, and 18.",
    options: ["337", "289", "337", "313"],
    answer: "337",
    solution: "LCM of 12, 16, 18 = 320. Required number = 320 - 17 = 337."
