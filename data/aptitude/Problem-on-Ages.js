    question: "The present age of a father is three times that of his son. After 5 years, the father's age will be twice that of his son. What is the present age of the son?",
    options: ["10", "15", "20", "25"],
    answer: "15",
    solution: "Let the son's age be x. Then father's age = 3x. After 5 years, 3x + 5 = 2(x + 5) ⇒ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 ⇒ x = 5. Son's age = 15."

  {
    question: "Ten years ago, a mother was 4 times as old as her daughter. Now, the mother is 2.5 times as old as the daughter. What is the daughter's present age?",
    options: ["10", "20", "30", "40"],
    answer: "20",
    solution: "Let daughter's age be x. Then mother's age = 2.5x. Ten years ago: 2.5x - 10 = 4(x - 10) ⇒ 2.5x - 10 = 4x - 40 ⇒ 1.5x = 30 ⇒ x = 20."
  },
  {
    question: "The sum of ages of A and B is 45 years. Five years ago, A was twice as old as B. What is the present age of B?",
    options: ["15", "20", "25", "30"],
    answer: "15",
    solution: "A + B = 45, A - 5 = 2(B - 5) ⇒ A = 2B - 5. Sub in first: 2B - 5 + B = 45 ⇒ 3B = 50 ⇒ B = 15."

  {
    question: "The present age of a man is twice that of his son. Five years ago, the man's age was three times the age of his son. What is the present age of the man?",
    options: ["30", "36", "40", "50"],
    answer: "40",
    solution: "Let son's age = x. Then man = 2x. 5 years ago: 2x - 5 = 3(x - 5) ⇒ 2x - 5 = 3x - 15 ⇒ x = 10, so man = 20."
  },
  {
    question: "A father said to his son, 'I was your age when you were born.' If the father is 36 now, how old is the son?",
    options: ["18", "20", "24", "28"],
    answer: "18",
    solution: "Let son's age = x. Then father's age at son's birth = 36 - x. Given: 36 - x = x ⇒ 2x = 36 ⇒ x = 18."
  },
  {
    question: "In 10 years, a boy will be twice as old as he was 10 years ago. What is his present age?",
    options: ["10", "20", "30", "40"],
    answer: "20",
    solution: "Let age = x. Then: x + 10 = 2(x - 10) ⇒ x + 10 = 2x - 20 ⇒ x = 30."
  },
  {
    question: "The ages of A and B are in the ratio 4:5. After 5 years, the ratio becomes 5:6. Find the present age of A.",
    options: ["20", "25", "30", "35"],
    answer: "20",
    solution: "Let A = 4x, B = 5x. Then: (4x+5)/(5x+5) = 5/6 ⇒ Cross multiply: 6(4x+5) = 5(5x+5) ⇒ 24x+30 = 25x+25 ⇒ x = 5 ⇒ A = 20."

  {
    question: "Father's age is 5 years more than thrice the age of his son. If the father is 35, find the son's age.",
    options: ["10", "12", "15", "18"],
    answer: "10",
    solution: "Let son's age = x. Then: 3x + 5 = 35 ⇒ 3x = 30 ⇒ x = 10."
  },
  {
    question: "The sum of the ages of a father and his son is 60 years. Five years ago, the father was four times as old as his son. What is the present age of the son?",
    options: ["10", "12", "15", "20"],
    answer: "12",
    solution: "F + S = 60, F - 5 = 4(S - 5). Sub F: 60 - S - 5 = 4S - 20 ⇒ 55 = 5S - 20 ⇒ S = 15."

    question: "The average age of 5 members in a family is 25 years. A new baby is born. The average becomes 22 years. Find the age of the baby.",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    answer: "2",
    solution: "Total age of 5 = 5×25 = 125. Total after baby = 6×22 = 132. Baby = 132 - 125 = 7."

    question: "The ratio of ages of two brothers is 3:4 and the sum of their ages is 56. What is the age of the elder brother?",
    options: ["24", "32", "36", "40"],
    answer: "32",
    solution: "Let ages = 3x and 4x. Then 3x + 4x = 56 ⇒ 7x = 56 ⇒ x = 8 ⇒ elder = 4x = 32."

    question: "A man is 24 years older than his son. In 2 years, his age will be twice that of his son. Find their present ages.",
    options: ["44, 20", "46, 22", "48, 24", "50, 26"],
    answer: "46, 22",
    solution: "Let son's age = x ⇒ man = x + 24 ⇒ x + 2 = (x+24)+2/2 ⇒ x + 2 = (x+26)/2 ⇒ 2x + 4 = x + 26 ⇒ x = 22."

    options: ["20", "22", "24", "26"],
    answer: "20",
    solution: "Let A = 5x, B = 6x. (5x+4)/(6x+4) = 6/7 ⇒ 7(5x+4) = 6(6x+4) ⇒ 35x+28 = 36x+24 ⇒ x = 4 ⇒ A = 20."

    question: "The ages of a father and son are in the ratio 7:2. After 10 years, the ratio becomes 9:4. What is the father's current age?",
    options: ["35", "40", "42", "45"],
    answer: "42",
    solution: "Let F = 7x, S = 2x. Then: (7x+10)/(2x+10) = 9/4 ⇒ Cross-mult: 4(7x+10) = 9(2x+10) ⇒ 28x+40 = 18x+90 ⇒ x=5 ⇒ F=35."

    question: "If the average age of A, B, and C is 24 years and the average age of A and B is 22 years, what is C’s age?",
    options: ["26", "28", "30", "32"],
    answer: "30",
    solution: "Total of A, B, C = 3×24 = 72; A+B = 2×22 = 44; C = 72 - 44 = 28."

    question: "A's present age is 2/5th of B’s present age. If after 8 years, A will be half of B’s age, what is A’s current age?",
    options: ["8", "10", "12", "14"],
    answer: "10",
    solution: "A = 2x, B = 5x. After 8 years: 2x + 8 = (5x + 8)/2 ⇒ 4x + 16 = 5x + 8 ⇒ x = 8 ⇒ A = 2x = 16."

    answer: "30",
    solution: "Let son's age = x. Then man = 3x. After 5 years: 3x + 5 = 4(x + 5) ⇒ 3x + 5 = 4x + 20 ⇒ x = -15. Not possible. Check question again."

    options: ["4", "6", "8", "10"],
    answer: "6",
    solution: "Let age = x, x+2, ..., x+8. Sum = 5x + 20 = 50 ⇒ x = 6."
