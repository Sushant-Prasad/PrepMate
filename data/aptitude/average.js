    question: "1. The average of 5 numbers is 27. If one number is excluded, the average becomes 25. What is the excluded number?",
    options: ["30", "35", "32", "37"],
    answer: "37",
    solution: "Total of 5 numbers = 5 × 27 = 135. Total of remaining 4 numbers = 4 × 25 = 100. Excluded number = 135 - 100 = 37."
  },
  {
    question: "2. The average of 10 numbers is 20. If each number is increased by 5, what will be the new average?",
    options: ["20", "25", "30", "15"],
    answer: "25",
    solution: "When each number is increased by 5, average also increases by 5. So, new average = 20 + 5 = 25."

  {
    question: "3. A cricketer has a batting average of 48 in 10 innings. How many runs must he score in the next innings to increase his average to 50?",
    options: ["60", "68", "70", "72"],
    answer: "70",
    solution: "Current total runs = 48 × 10 = 480. To get average 50 in 11 innings, required total = 50 × 11 = 550. So, he must score 550 - 480 = 70 runs."
  },
  {
    question: "4. The average of three numbers is 60. If two of the numbers are 40 and 80, what is the third number?",
    options: ["60", "50", "70", "100"],
    answer: "60",
    solution: "Total of 3 numbers = 60 × 3 = 180. Sum of two numbers = 40 + 80 = 120. So, third number = 180 - 120 = 60."
  },
  {
    question: "5. The average weight of 8 persons increases by 2.5 kg when a new person replaces one who weighed 65 kg. What is the weight of the new person?",
    options: ["75 kg", "85 kg", "90 kg", "85.5 kg"],
    answer: "85 kg",
    solution: "Increase in total weight = 8 × 2.5 = 20 kg. New person weighs 65 + 20 = 85 kg."
  },
  {
    question: "6. The average age of a family of 6 members is 25 years. If the youngest member is 5 years old, what is the average age of the remaining members?",
    options: ["28", "27", "30", "29"],
    answer: "28",
    solution: "Total age = 6 × 25 = 150. Remaining members' total = 150 - 5 = 145. Average = 145 / 5 = 29."
  },
  {
    question: "7. The average of 7 consecutive numbers is 20. What is the largest number?",
    options: ["24", "23", "21", "22"],
    answer: "23",
    solution: "Average = middle number in odd number set. So, middle = 20. Largest = 20 + 3 = 23."

    question: "8. The average salary of 15 employees is ₹40,000. The average salary of 5 of them is ₹60,000. What is the average salary of the remaining 10 employees?",
    options: ["₹30,000", "₹35,000", "₹36,000", "₹38,000"],
    answer: "₹30,000",
    solution: "Total = 15×40000 = ₹6,00,000. 5×60000 = ₹3,00,000. Remaining 10 = ₹6,00,000 - ₹3,00,000 = ₹3,00,000. Average = ₹3,00,000 / 10 = ₹30,000."

  {
    question: "9. The average of four numbers is 45. Three of them are 40, 50, and 55. What is the fourth number?",
    options: ["35", "40", "35", "30"],
    answer: "35",
    solution: "Total = 4 × 45 = 180. Sum of three = 40 + 50 + 55 = 145. Fourth number = 180 - 145 = 35."

  {
    question: "10. The average age of a class of 20 students is 12 years. If the teacher’s age is included, the average becomes 13. What is the teacher’s age?",
    options: ["30", "32", "35", "34"],
    answer: "32",
    solution: "Total age of 20 students = 20 × 12 = 240. New total = 21 × 13 = 273. Teacher’s age = 273 - 240 = 33."
  },
  {
    question: "11. The average of five consecutive odd numbers is 45. What is the smallest number?",
    options: ["41", "43", "45", "47"],
    answer: "41",
    solution: "In 5 consecutive odd numbers, average is middle one. So numbers are 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. Smallest = 41."
  },
  {
    question: "12. The average marks obtained by 50 students in a test is 72. The average marks of the top 10 students is 90. What is the average of the remaining 40 students?",
    options: ["68", "70", "71", "73"],
    answer: "68",
    solution: "Total = 50 × 72 = 3600. Top 10 = 10 × 90 = 900. Remaining = 3600 - 900 = 2700. Average = 2700 / 40 = 67.5 → approx 68."

  {
    question: "13. The average temperature of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday was 40°C. The average of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday was 41°C. If the temperature on Monday was 39°C, what was Thursday’s temperature?",
    options: ["42°C", "43°C", "41°C", "44°C"],
    answer: "44°C",
    solution: "M+T+W = 120; T+W+Th = 123; Subtract → Th - M = 3 → Th = 39 + 3 = 42."

  {
    question: "14. The average of a group of 7 numbers is 56. If two numbers are removed, the average becomes 54. What is the sum of the two removed numbers?",
    options: ["114", "112", "110", "108"],
    answer: "112",
    solution: "Original total = 56×7 = 392. New total = 54×5 = 270. Sum removed = 392 - 270 = 122."

    question: "15. A man spends ₹1800 monthly, and his average monthly income is ₹2000. What is his annual savings?",
    options: ["₹2400", "₹2200", "₹2000", "₹1800"],
    answer: "₹2400",
    solution: "Monthly saving = ₹2000 - ₹1800 = ₹200. Annual saving = ₹200 × 12 = ₹2400."
