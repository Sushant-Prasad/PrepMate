    question: "The ratio of the ages of two persons is 4:5 and the sum of their ages is 72 years. What is the age of the younger person?",
    options: ["28 years", "32 years", "36 years", "40 years"],
    answer: "32 years",
    solution: "Let their ages be 4x and 5x. So, 4x + 5x = 72 → 9x = 72 → x = 8. Younger = 4x = 32 years."

  {
    question: "Two numbers are in the ratio 3:4. If their difference is 20, what is the smaller number?",
    options: ["30", "40", "50", "60"],
    answer: "60",
    solution: "Let the numbers be 3x and 4x. Difference = 4x - 3x = x = 20 → x = 20. Smaller = 3x = 60."

  {
    question: "If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, what is A:C?",
    options: ["8:15", "2:5", "4:9", "3:10"],
    answer: "8:15",
    solution: "A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5 → B common: LCM of 3 and 4 is 12. So A:B = 8:12, B:C = 12:15 → A:C = 8:15."

    question: "Divide ₹500 in the ratio 2:3 between A and B. What is B's share?",
    options: ["₹200", "₹250", "₹300", "₹350"],
    answer: "₹300",
    solution: "Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5. B's share = (3/5)×500 = ₹300."
  },
  {
    question: "Two numbers are in the ratio 7:9. If the sum is 128, what is the larger number?",
    options: ["56", "72", "64", "66"],
    answer: "72",
    solution: "7x + 9x = 128 → 16x = 128 → x = 8 → Larger = 9x = 72."
  },
  {
    question: "A and B earn salaries in the ratio 5:6. If A's salary is ₹25,000, what is B's salary?",
    options: ["₹30,000", "₹28,000", "₹32,000", "₹35,000"],
    answer: "₹30,000",
    solution: "5x = 25000 → x = 5000 → B's salary = 6x = ₹30,000."
  },
  {
    question: "The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:2. If there are 30 students, how many are girls?",
    options: ["12", "15", "18", "20"],
    answer: "12",
    solution: "Total parts = 3 + 2 = 5 → Each part = 30/5 = 6 → Girls = 2×6 = 12."
  },
  {
    question: "A sum of ₹1200 is divided among A, B, and C in the ratio 2:3:5. What is C’s share?",
    options: ["₹400", "₹600", "₹500", "₹300"],
    answer: "₹600",
    solution: "Total parts = 10 → C’s share = (5/10)×1200 = ₹600."
  },
  {
    question: "If the ratio of income to expenditure is 5:3, then what is the ratio of savings to income?",
    options: ["2:5", "3:5", "5:2", "2:3"],
    answer: "2:5",
    solution: "Savings = 5 - 3 = 2 → Savings:Income = 2:5."

  {
    question: "A train covers 360 km in 6 hours. Another train covers the same distance in 4.5 hours. What is the ratio of their speeds?",
    options: ["4:3", "3:4", "2:3", "5:6"],
    answer: "3:2",
    solution: "Speed = distance/time → First: 360/6 = 60, Second: 360/4.5 = 80 → Ratio = 60:80 = 3:4."
  },
  {
    question: "In a college, the ratio of boys to girls is 7:5. If there are 1800 students, how many boys are there?",
    options: ["1050", "750", "900", "1200"],
    answer: "1050",
    solution: "Total parts = 12 → Each part = 1800/12 = 150 → Boys = 7×150 = 1050."
  },
  {
    question: "If a:b = 3:4 and b:c = 2:5, then a:c = ?",
    options: ["3:10", "3:8", "6:5", "1:2"],
    answer: "3:10",
    solution: "a:b = 3:4 and b:c = 2:5 → Convert b to common = 4 and 2 → LCM = 4 → a:b = 3:4, b:c = 4:10 → a:c = 3:10."
  },
  {
    question: "₹800 is divided among A, B, and C in the ratio 1:2:3. What is B's share?",
    options: ["₹200", "₹100", "₹300", "₹400"],
    answer: "₹200",
    solution: "Total parts = 1+2+3 = 6 → B’s share = (2/6)×800 = ₹200."
  },
  {
    question: "If the speed of a car is increased in the ratio 2:3, how much time will it take to cover the same distance?",
    options: ["In the ratio 3:2", "In the ratio 2:3", "Remains same", "In the ratio 1:1"],
    answer: "In the ratio 3:2",
    solution: "Speed and time are inversely proportional. So ratio of time = 3:2."

    question: "The ratio of two numbers is 4:7. If their difference is 18, what is the smaller number?",
    options: ["36", "42", "30", "28"],
    answer: "36",
    solution: "Let the numbers be 4x and 7x → 7x - 4x = 3x = 18 → x = 6 → Smaller = 4×6 = 36."
