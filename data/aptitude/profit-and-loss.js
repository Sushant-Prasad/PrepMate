    answer: "4%",

    answer: "21%",
    solution: "Cost price of 1 orange = 10/11, Selling price = 11/10; Gain = SP - CP = 11/10 - 10/11 = (121 - 100)/110 = 21/110 = 19.1%"

    answer: "₹200",
    solution: "Let CP = x; 10% loss ⇒ SP = 0.9x; 10% gain ⇒ SP = 1.1x; So 1.1x - 0.9x = ₹40 ⇒ 0.2x = 40 ⇒ x = 200"

    answer: "₹400",
    solution: "Let CP = x; SP1 = 0.9x, SP2 = 1.05x ⇒ 1.05x - 0.9x = 60 ⇒ 0.15x = 60 ⇒ x = 400"
