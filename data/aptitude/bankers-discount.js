    question: "1. The difference between the banker’s discount and the true discount on a certain sum due 6 months hence at 10% per annum is ₹15. What is the sum?",
    options: ["₹3000", "₹2500", "₹2000", "₹1500"],
    answer: "₹3000",
    solution: "Banker's Gain = BD - TD = ₹15. Formula: Gain = (TD × r × t) / 100. Let TD = x, then 15 = (x × 10 × 0.5)/100 ⇒ x = ₹300. Since TD = (P × r × t)/(100 + (r × t)), solving gives sum = ₹3000."

    question: "2. The banker’s gain on a certain sum due 8 months hence at 12% per annum is ₹20. What is the true discount?",
    options: ["₹100", "₹80", "₹60", "₹50"],
    answer: "₹80",
    solution: "Banker's Gain = (TD × r × t)/100. Let TD = x. Then, 20 = (x × 12 × 8/12) / 100 ⇒ x = ₹80."

      "Banker’s Discount and True Discount",
      "Simple Interest and True Discount",
      "Banker’s Discount and Simple Interest",

    question: "4. The banker’s discount on a bill due 9 months hence at 8% per annum is ₹120. What is the face value of the bill?",
    options: ["₹1800", "₹2000", "₹2100", "₹2200"],
    answer: "₹2000",
    solution: "BD = (P × r × t) / 100 ⇒ 120 = (P × 8 × 9/12) / 100 ⇒ P = ₹2000."

    question: "5. A bill of ₹500 is due after 4 months. The rate of interest is 6% p.a. What is the banker’s gain?",
    options: ["₹0.50", "₹1", "₹1.25", "₹0.75"],
    answer: "₹0.75",
    solution: "BD = (500 × 6 × 4/12) / 100 = ₹10. TD = (500 × 6 × 4/12) / (100 + (6 × 4/12)) = ₹9.25. Gain = 10 - 9.25 = ₹0.75."

    options: ["₹6", "₹5", "₹4", "₹3"],
    answer: "₹6",
    solution: "Banker’s Gain = BD - TD = 96 - 90 = ₹6."

    options: ["₹170", "₹165", "₹160", "₹150"],
    answer: "₹170",
    solution: "BD = TD + Gain = 160 + 10 = ₹170."

    options: ["₹300", "₹250", "₹200", "₹150"],
    answer: "₹300",
    solution: "BD = (6000 × 10 × 6/12) / 100 = ₹300."

    options: ["6.66%", "7%", "10%", "6%"],
    answer: "6.66%",
    solution: "Gain = 160 - 150 = ₹10. Gain = (TD × r × t) / 100 ⇒ 10 = (150 × r × 1)/100 ⇒ r = 6.66%."

      "BG = BD + TD",
      "BG = (BD × TD) / 100"
    ],
    answer: "BG = BD - TD",
    solution: "By definition, Banker’s Gain = Banker’s Discount - True Discount."

    options: ["10%", "12%", "9%", "11.11%"],
    answer: "10%",
    solution: "Gain = TD / 9 ⇒ Gain = (TD × r × t) / 100 ⇒ TD/9 = (TD × r × 1)/100 ⇒ r = 100/9 = 11.11%."
