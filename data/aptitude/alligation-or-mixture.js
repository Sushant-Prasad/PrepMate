    question: "A mixture contains milk and water in the ratio 5:1. How much water should be added to 30 liters of the mixture to change the ratio to 5:2?",
    options: ["5 liters", "6 liters", "7 liters", "8 liters"],
    answer: "6 liters",
    solution: "Milk in 30 liters = (5/6) × 30 = 25 liters. Let x liters of water be added.\nThen, (25)/(5 + x) = 5/2 ⇒ 25×2 = 5×(30 + x) ⇒ x = 6."

    question: "In what ratio must rice costing Rs. 40/kg be mixed with rice costing Rs. 60/kg so that the mixture costs Rs. 50/kg?",
    options: ["1:1", "2:3", "1:2", "1:1.5"],
    answer: "1:1",
    solution: "Using alligation:\n(60 - 50):(50 - 40) = 10:10 = 1:1"
  },
  {
    question: "A mixture of 45 liters contains milk and water in the ratio 4:1. How much water must be added to make the ratio 3:2?",
    options: ["7 liters", "9 liters", "10 liters", "12 liters"],
    answer: "9 liters",
    solution: "Milk = (4/5)×45 = 36L, Water = 9L\nLet x be water added: 36:(9 + x) = 3:2 ⇒ x = 9L"
  },
  {
    question: "How many liters of water must be added to 60 L of milk at Rs. 18/L to get a mixture worth Rs. 15/L?",
    options: ["12L", "18L", "24L", "30L"],
    answer: "12L",
    solution: "Using alligation: (18 - 15):(15 - 0) = 3:15 = 1:5 ⇒ Water = (60 × 1)/5 = 12L"
  },
  {
    question: "A container contains milk and water in the ratio 7:5. If 6 liters of water is added, the ratio becomes 7:6. Find the original quantity of milk.",
    options: ["21L", "28L", "35L", "42L"],
    answer: "42L",
    solution: "Let milk = 7x, water = 5x\nThen, (7x)/(5x + 6) = 7/6 ⇒ x = 6 ⇒ Milk = 7×6 = 42L"
  },
  {
    question: "In what ratio must alcohol costing Rs. 80/L be mixed with alcohol costing Rs. 60/L to get a mixture worth Rs. 70/L?",
    options: ["1:1", "1:2", "2:1", "3:2"],
    answer: "1:1",
    solution: "Using alligation: (80 - 70):(70 - 60) = 10:10 = 1:1"
  },
  {
    question: "Two vessels contain milk and water in ratio 5:2 and 3:4. In what ratio should quantities be mixed to get a mixture in the ratio 1:1?",
    options: ["3:4", "4:3", "5:6", "7:5"],
    answer: "3:4",
    solution: "Let quantity mixed in x:y. Then\n(5x/7 + 3y/7)/(2x/7 + 4y/7) = 1 ⇒ solve to get x:y = 3:4"
  },
  {
    question: "A 60-liter mixture has milk and water in 2:1 ratio. How much water must be added to make the ratio 1:1?",
    options: ["10L", "20L", "30L", "15L"],
    answer: "20L",
    solution: "Milk = 40L, Water = 20L\nTo make 1:1, water = 40L ⇒ add 20L"
  },
  {
    question: "How much milk costing Rs. 50/L must be mixed with 20L of milk costing Rs. 30/L to make mixture worth Rs. 40/L?",
    options: ["10L", "15L", "20L", "25L"],
    answer: "20L",
    solution: "Alligation: (50 - 40):(40 - 30) = 10:10 = 1:1 ⇒ Mix 20L of 50Rs milk"
  },
  {
    question: "In what ratio must tea worth Rs. 72/kg be mixed with tea worth Rs. 60/kg to get a mixture worth Rs. 66/kg?",
    options: ["1:1", "2:1", "1:2", "3:2"],
    answer: "1:1",
    solution: "Alligation: (72 - 66):(66 - 60) = 6:6 = 1:1"
  },
  {
    question: "Milk and water are mixed in the ratio 4:1. How much of the mixture must be taken out and replaced with water to make ratio 2:1?",
    options: ["1/5", "1/6", "1/4", "1/3"],
    answer: "1/6",
    solution: "Use alligation and proportion: Required fraction is 1/6"
  },
  {
    question: "In what ratio should 25% alcohol solution be mixed with 60% to get 40% alcohol?",
    options: ["2:1", "3:1", "4:3", "4:1"],
    answer: "4:3",
    solution: "Alligation: (60 - 40):(40 - 25) = 20:15 = 4:3"

  {
    question: "How much water must be added to 40L of milk to get mixture in 4:1 ratio?",
    options: ["10L", "5L", "15L", "20L"],
    answer: "10L",
    solution: "Let water = x, 40:x = 4:1 ⇒ x = 10L"
