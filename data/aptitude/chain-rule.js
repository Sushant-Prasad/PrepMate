    question: "If 6 men can complete a work in 8 days, how many men are needed to complete the same work in 4 days?",
    options: ["12", "6", "8", "10"],
    answer: "12",
    solution: "Men ∝ 1/Days. So, M1 × D1 = M2 × D2 → 6 × 8 = M2 × 4 → M2 = 12"

    question: "If 15 men can build a wall in 20 days, how many men are needed to build the same wall in 12 days?",
    options: ["25", "30", "20", "15"],
    answer: "25",
    solution: "15 × 20 = M × 12 → M = (15×20)/12 = 25"

    options: ["12", "6", "8", "10"],
    answer: "12",
    solution: "Machines × Time ∝ Work → 4×6 : x×4 = 48:96 → 24x = 384 → x = 12"

    options: ["10", "8", "12", "15"],
    answer: "10",
    solution: "8×15 = 12×D → D = (8×15)/12 = 10"

    question: "If 6 men or 12 women can complete a job in 15 days, how many days will 3 men and 6 women take?",
    options: ["15", "20", "30", "25"],
    answer: "15",
    solution: "6M = 12W → 1M = 2W → 3M+6W = 6+6 = 12W → Same work as 12W → 15 days"

    options: ["10", "12", "11", "9"],
    answer: "10",
    solution: "Total work = 10×12 = 120. Work done in 4 days = 10×4 = 40. Remaining = 80. Now 8 men → 80/8 = 10 days"
