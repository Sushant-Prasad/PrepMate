    options: ["100 m", "50√3 m", "100√3 m", "75 m"],

    options: ["50 m", "66.67 m", "33.33 m", "40 m"],
    answer: "33.33 m",
    solution: "Let platform height = h. Using triangle ratios: h = 100 * tan(30°) / (tan(60°) + tan(30°)) = 100 * 1/√3 / (√3 + 1/√3) = 33.33 m."

    options: ["30°", "45°", "60°", "90°"],
    answer: "30°",
    solution: "Let height = h. Then tan θ = h / (√3 h) = 1/√3 ⇒ θ = 30°."

    question: "The top of a tree broken over by the wind makes an angle of 30° with the ground and the top touches the ground 10 m from the base. What was the height of the tree?",
    options: ["15 m", "20 m", "10 m", "17.32 m"],
    answer: "15 m",
    solution: "Let the unbroken part = h, broken part = x ⇒ tan(30°) = x / h ⇒ x = h / √3. By Pythagoras: h² + x² = 100 ⇒ Solve to get h = 11.25, x ≈ 3.75 ⇒ Total = 15 m."

    options: ["43.3 m", "50 m", "25√3 m", "30 m"],
    answer: "43.3 m",
    solution: "Let height = h. From triangle A: h = x tan(60°) = √3 x; From B: h = (x + 50) tan(30°) = (x + 50)/√3 ⇒ Solve: √3 x = (x + 50)/√3 ⇒ x = 25 ⇒ h = √3 × 25 ≈ 43.3 m."
