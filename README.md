🎯 PrepMate – Smart Placement Preparation Platform

PrepMate is a frontend-based, responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to provide a collaborative and structured environment for students preparing for campus placements.

This project focuses on solving key issues like lack of structured content, peer guidance, and real-time collaboration during placement prep.

🧭 Project Objective

The main objective is to build a clean, functional, and user-friendly web interface that helps students:
- Practice DSA and aptitude questions
- Join peer study rooms
- Track their preparation progress
- Access company-specific interview questions

 🧠 Why We Chose This Project

We observed that most placement prep websites lack:
- A collaborative learning space
- Properly structured learning paths
- Engaging UI for goal tracking

PrepMate fills this gap by combining a clear UI with practical learning modules — all while keeping the tech stack simple and accessible.
